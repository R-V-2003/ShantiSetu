                <p><h3>By Dalai Lama</h3>
                    <h4>How yoga can help you unwind</h4>
                    A very common cause of sleeping disorders is stress. Stress prevents the body and the mind from relaxing and keeps thousands of people awake at night. And this is where yoga can make the difference. A gentle, restorative yoga practice can help to calm down the mind and to release physical tension. This type of yoga practice activates the parasympathetic nervous system or the bodies “rest-and-digest” system, which helps to counteract physical and mental stress.<br>

                    <br>Below you can find five yoga poses to help relieve tension in the body and the mind. Ideally they are practiced one hour to 30 minutes before going to sleep, or you can even do them in bed. They are easy poses to be held three to five minutes for maximum effect.<br>
                    
                    <h3>1.Savasana – Corpse Pose</h3>
                    Savasana or Corpse Pose is a very beneficial pose to calm down the mind and to relieve stress. It is commonly the starting and ending pose of any yoga practice.<br>

                    <br>-Lie down on your back<br>
                    -Feet are mat width apart, toes dropping out<br>
                    -Arms are relaxed by your side, palms facing up<br>
                    -Shoulders are away from the ears, relaxing on the mat<br>
                    -Back of the neck is long, chin slightly tucked in<br>
                    <br>People with lower back pain might like to place a cushion under their knees to relieve tension in the lower back. If you feel tension in the neck you can also place a blanket or a low cushion under the head to keep the back of the neck long. As you lie in this pose, bring your focus to your breath, observing each inhalation and exhalation. Feel the expansion of your belly as you inhale and observe your belly relax as you exhale.<br>
                
                    <h3>2.Anuloma Viloma – Alternate Nostril Breathing</h3>
                    Anulom Vilom or Alternate Nostril Breathing is an excellent breathing exercise to balance the right and left side of the brain and to calm down your thoughts.<br>

<br>-Sit in a comfortable position<br>
-Place your left hand in Chin Mudra (tip of the thumb and index finger touching)<br>
-Place  your right hand in Vishnu Mudra (bending the index and middle finger)<br>
-Place your right thumb on your right nostril and breathe in through your left nostril for four counts<br>
-Close both nostrils using your right thumb and your right ring finger and little finger and hold your breath for eight counts<br>
-Release your thumb and breathe out through your right nostril for eight counts<br>
-Breathe in again through your right nostril for four counts<br>
-Close both nostrils using your right thumb and your right ring finger and little finger and hold your breath for eight counts<br>
-Breathe out through your left nostril for eight counts<br>
<br>This is one round. Continue this breathing exercise for five minutes. Once you feel comfortable with this ratio, you can hold your breath for 16 counts. While practicing Anulom Vilom, keep your focus on your breath, following each movement of your breath. This breathing exercise activates the parasympathetic nervous system, slows down the breath and the heart beat. Because you breathe in and out separately through each nostril for the same count, both hemispheres receive an equal amount of oxygen. The hemispheres are balanced and the mind is calmed down.<br>

<h3>3.Shashankasana – Child’s Pose</h3>
The following pose in this sequence for a good night sleep is Child’s Pose or Shashankasana (also called Balasana).<br>

<br>-Sit on your knees in Diamond Pose, back straight<br>
-Keep your hips on your knees and bend forward until your forehead touches the floor.<br>
-Arms are relaxed by your side, palms of the hands facing up.<br>
<br>When you are in this pose the hips should be resting on your heels and the head should be resting on the floor. If this is difficult you can make two fists and place your forehead on your fists or place your forehead on a cushion. If required you can also open the knees apart or place a cushion in between your hips and heels. Make sure you feel comfortable. With each exhalation let go of any tension in your body.<br>
                
<h3>4.Supta Baddhakonasana – Lying Butterfly Pose</h3>
Baddhakon asana is a very good yoga pose to increase hip flexibility. It is said that emotions such as tension, stress, anger, etc. are stored in the pelvis. By working on hip flexibility, the tensions in the hip joint and as a consequence also emotional tensions are relieved.<br>

<br>-Place the souls of your feet together and let your knees drop out<br>
-Gently lean back and lie down on your back, keeping the souls of your feet together<br>
-Arms are relaxed by your side, palms facing up<br>
<br>If you can’t lie down completely on your back, you can use a bolster and lie on the bolster. Make sure your head and back are properly supported. If you feel tension in your knees you can place a cushion under your thighs to reduce the tension in the knees. Once you are comfortably in the pose, bring your focus to your pelvis. Use each exhalation to release the tension in your hip joints, and try to relax completely.<br>

<h3>5.Legs-up-the-wall pose</h3>
The legs-up-the-wall pose is a very gentle inversion which improves blood circulation in your lower limbs. It is a very relaxing pose after a long day of standing on your feet.<br>

<br>-Lie down on your back, hips touching the wall<br>
-Place your legs straight against the wall so your legs and upper body form a 90 degree angle<br>
-You can keep your legs together or open your legs wide for an extra stretch of the inner thighs<br>
-You can place your hands on your belly or relax your arms by your side, palms facing up<br>

<br>Enjoy the relaxing yoga poses....
