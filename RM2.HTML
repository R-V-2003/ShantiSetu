                <p>Yoga nidra is a unique practice in that it helps one enter the deepest states of rest while remaining awake. <br>Having said that, itâ€™s completely acceptable, and even encouraged, for you to fall asleep if your body requires sleep at this time.<br>

                    Some benefits of deep rest include, but are not limited to, a reduction in stress and anxiety, helps to lower blood pressure, releases tension and pain in the body, and can help improve concentration and focus, creativity, sleep and overall well-being.<br>
                    
                    Soft ocean waves accompany this recording to help you further be lulled into deep rest and relaxation. <br>May you move through your day feeling well rested and at ease.</p>
